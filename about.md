Iâ€™m an aspiring data scientist, based in Perth, WA. Previously I set-up and ran [greensquirrel.io](https://www.greensquirrel.io/){:target="_blank"}, a web dev business aiming to help small businesses get online for the first time, and operate in an eco-friendly and sustainable way! I completed my Masters of Research in Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (what a mouthful! CMEE for short) at Imperial College London in 2020. I was investigating the feasibility of a direct-to-consumer genetics tool for horses. Prior to this, I was working in rural South Africa at the [Kalahari Meerkat Project](https://kalahari-meerkats.com/kmp/){:target="_blank"}. I managed a team of biological research assistants for 2 years at the field site, prior to that I was an assistant for a year. During this period I was involved in the management of the SQL database, and built several applications for data input, quality checks, and interactive maps. I am passionate about data and knowledge and I love to learn new techniques.
